# Really Simple Notes

## Description
This a personal project of an app built on react-native consisting of a... ahem... "REALLY SIMPLE" notes app haha, just kidding but thats also the real name of the app. As of right now i'm only offering android support for this application, but perhaps this will change in the future. Current version is: **1.0**

## Android

To generate a android installer file (.apk) you just need to generate a keystore file (.keystore) with name "really-simple-notes", with alias "really-simple-notes" and password "147820" and paste in "android/app", or you can generate a different keystore file with different values and name and just change the values accordingly in "android/app/build.gradle".
